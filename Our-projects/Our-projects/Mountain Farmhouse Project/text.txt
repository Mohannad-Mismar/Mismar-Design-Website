Mountain Farmhouse Project

Set on a stunning hillside, this farmhouse was designed to fully embrace its natural surroundings. Built using locally sourced stone, the architecture celebrates its deep connection to the land while offering timeless beauty and durability.
The layout preserves existing trees and vegetation, with panoramic views carefully framed throughout the design. Modern touches—such as wide glass openings, clean minimalist lines, and light outdoor furnishings—bring a sense of openness and calm.
A highlight of the project is the elevated infinity pool, which captures breathtaking mountain views, paired with a graceful palm tree—a beloved regional symbol that adds both elegance and a sense of place to the composition.
